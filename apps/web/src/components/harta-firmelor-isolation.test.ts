/**
 * The harta-firmelor card belongs on the COMPANY page and nowhere else.
 *
 * That was agreed before a line was written: their embed is a trade-registry
 * snapshot of a firm, which means nothing beside a contracting authority. The
 * guarantee today is structural rather than conditional, and a structural
 * guarantee is exactly the kind that erodes silently: one barrel export, or one
 * authority component reaching for a company one, and the card lands on a page
 * it has no business being on with every test still green.
 *
 * So the import graph is read off the file tree instead of trusted to a
 * docblock. Nothing here is a hand-kept list: the walk finds every source under
 * `src/` and computes reachability, so a new importer reds this the day it is
 * added.
 *
 * Written without spread over iterators on purpose: this package's TypeScript
 * target rejects it (TS2802).

 * "./company-all"`. Counting it would fail this guard on an import that cannot
 * put a card on any page, which is the difference between measuring the module
 * graph and measuring what renders.
 *
 * The exclusion is per STATEMENT, and that word is load-bearing. It used to be
 * per SPECIFIER — collect the type-only specifiers, then filter every specifier
 * equal to one of them — which meant a single plausible line disabled the whole
 * guard. The authority page already carries `import type { SearchParams } from
 * "@/components"`. Add the value import the barrel exists to invite, `import
 * { ListItem } from "@/components"`, and BOTH edges vanish: the walk stayed at
 * 18 files and stayed green while the card really was in the authority page's
 * module graph. The control that proved it was the same value import without
 * the type import beside it — walk 49 files, guard red.
 *
 * `import("...")` counts too. `next/dynamic` around a lazily-loaded card is a
 * plausible refactor, and the old specifier regex required whitespace after
 * `import`, so a dynamic import was simply not an edge. Combined with a local
 * rename it put the card on the authority page past all four assertions.

 * The height listener must go through `isTrustedEmbedOrigin`, not a literal.

 * A cross-origin frame posts from the host it was loaded from, so a listener
 * validating `event.origin` against any other host rejects every message the
 * frame sends. Nothing in this suite would go red for it: the card would simply
 * never resize. That is not hypothetical. The frame briefly loaded from a
 * different host than the anchor pointed at, and the wrong comparison in this
 * listener would have shipped green.
 *
 * There is one origin again, so a hand-inlined comparison would be CORRECT
 * today. These assertions keep it out anyway: the predicate is the only form of
 * the check a test can call (the runner is `environment: "node"` with no DOM, so
 * the component cannot be mounted), and it is the seam a second origin would be
 * added to instead of a second literal appearing here.

 * SOURCE TEXT. None of them runs the listener, so none of them can observe a
 * message being accepted or rejected — they fail only when the text changes.
 * They are pins, deliberately, and they are named as pins; they were previously
 * named as if they verified behaviour, which put the `event.source` half of the
 * brief's criterion 5 on record as tested by nothing at all.

 * production build with a positive control (SMOKE-SICAP-AI.md section 3.4):
 * a message with harta's origin and the WRONG source left the frame at 236px,
